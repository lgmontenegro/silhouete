# Silhouete Fullfilment Chalenge.

To run this solution, put index.php and Silhouete.php in same directory as the case files.
The case file was specified in the challenge.

My solution consists in find the highest pile and sum the difference between the lowest piles foward until find a pile higher then the last one.

When a higher pile is found, the algorithm sums the differences with a accumulator, change the higher pile and do the proccess again until then and of the file's arrays.

I used recursion to walk throught the grid array due to its the simplest way to code this solution, in my view, and because I didn't have enought time to code it.

I also submit the first solution, done with functions, that helped me to code the silhouet class. It was my lab.

To run it just put the index.php and Silhouete.php files with the case file (the grid file) and run:
```php -f index *grid_file_name* -d (opitional, for debuging)```

This command will generate an result file called result_grid_file_name.
